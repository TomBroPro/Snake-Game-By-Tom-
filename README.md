Copy and paste the files into python (make sure to install pygame and py2app. Run in terminal, 'pip install pygame' and 'pip install py2app' Now you should be ready to go!)
To run the files you need to make a dmg by runing 'python setup.py py2app' into terminal on python.
If you go into your python creations file, click on the one you want to make dmg and go into disk and it should be there.
